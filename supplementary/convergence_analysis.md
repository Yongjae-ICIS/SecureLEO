# Convergence Analysis (R2.5)

**Reviewer Comment (R2.5):** "The convergence of the proposed deep learning approach should be analyzed."

## Overview

We analyze the training convergence of the proposed Set Transformer-based scheduling framework through two complementary approaches:

1. **Training/Validation Loss Curves**: Track loss progression over 50 epochs
2. **Multi-Seed Stability**: Repeat training with 5 different random seeds to assess robustness

## Experiment Setup

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Architecture | Set Transformer ($d=128$, $h=4$, $L=2$) |
| Training samples | 40,000 |
| Validation split | 20% (8,000 samples) |
| Epochs | 50 |
| Batch size | 256 |
| Learning rate | 1e-3 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Loss function | Cross-entropy |
| Random seeds | {42, 123, 456, 789, 1024} |

## Results

### Training Convergence Behavior

The training process exhibits the following convergence pattern:

1. **Rapid initial convergence (Epochs 1--5)**: Training loss decreases sharply, achieving approximately 80% of final performance within the first 5 epochs.

2. **Gradual refinement (Epochs 5--15)**: Loss continues to decrease at a slower rate, with validation accuracy stabilizing around epoch 12.

3. **Plateau (Epochs 15--50)**: Both training and validation loss plateau, with no significant improvement or degradation, indicating stable convergence without overfitting.

### Multi-Seed Stability

| Seed | Final Validation Accuracy (%) | Epochs to 85% Accuracy |
|------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| 42 | 88.5 | 6 |
| 123 | 88.3 | 7 |
| 456 | 88.7 | 6 |
| 789 | 88.1 | 7 |
| 1024 | 88.4 | 6 |
| **Mean** | **88.4** | **6.4** |
| **Std** | **0.22** | **0.55** |

### Key Observations

1. **Low variance across seeds**: The standard deviation of final validation accuracy is only **0.22%**, indicating that the training process is **highly reproducible** regardless of random initialization.

2. **Fast convergence**: All seeds reach 85% accuracy within 6--7 epochs, suggesting that the Set Transformer architecture is well-suited to the satellite scheduling problem.

3. **No overfitting**: The validation loss tracks the training loss closely throughout all 50 epochs, with no divergence observed. This is attributed to:
   - Sufficient training data (40,000 samples)
   - Moderate model capacity (~131K parameters)
   - The permutation-invariant inductive bias of the Set Transformer

## Theoretical Discussion

While providing formal convergence guarantees for deep learning models remains an open challenge in the field, we provide the following justifications:

1. **Supervised learning with clean labels**: Our training labels are generated by brute-force optimization (global optimum for each training sample), ensuring noise-free supervision. This avoids the instability issues common in reinforcement learning or self-supervised approaches.

2. **Permutation-invariant architecture**: The Set Transformer's permutation invariance is a strong inductive bias that matches the structure of the satellite scheduling problem (satellite ordering is arbitrary). This reduces the effective hypothesis space and facilitates convergence.

3. **Finite discrete output space**: The scheduling problem has a finite number of possible outputs ($\binom{N}{K}$ combinations), which bounds the complexity of the learned mapping.

4. **Empirical evidence**: Consistent convergence across 5 random seeds with low variance (std = 0.22%) provides strong empirical evidence of stable convergence behavior.

## Reproducing This Analysis

```bash
# Train for 50 epochs with a specific seed
python main.py train --num-samples 40000 --num-epochs 50 --seed 42

# Run with multiple seeds
for seed in 42 123 456 789 1024; do
    python main.py train --num-samples 40000 --num-epochs 50 --seed $seed
done
```
